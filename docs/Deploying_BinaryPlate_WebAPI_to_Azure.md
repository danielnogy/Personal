# Deploying BinaryPlate.WebAPI to Azure
 
Deploying a project like BinaryPlate.WebAPI to Azure using Visual Studio 2022 involves several steps, including adjusting connection strings and configuring deployment settings. Below is a detailed walkthrough:

**Step 1: Prepare your Azure Resources**

1.  Ensure you have an Azure SQL Database set up in your Azure subscription.
2.  Note down the connection string for your Azure SQL Database.

**Step 2: Open the BinaryPlate.WebAPI Solution in Visual Studio 2022**

1.  Launch Visual Studio 2022.
2.  Open the BinaryPlate.WebAPI project solution.

**Step 3: Adjust Connection Strings in appsettings.json**

1.  Locate the **appsettings.json** file in your project.
2.  Find the **MultiTenantSharedDbConnection** and **HangfireDbConnection** connection strings.
3.  Update the connection strings to point to your Azure SQL Database. Replace placeholders such as **ServerName**, **DatabaseName**, **Username**, and **Password** with the appropriate values obtained from your Azure SQL Database configuration.

Example of updated **appsettings.json**:

    // This section contains the database connection strings
     "ConnectionStrings": {
     // Multi-Tenant Shared Database Connection String
     "MultiTenantSharedDbConnection": "Server=<AzureSqlServerName>.database.windows.net;Database=<YourDatabaseName>;User Id=<YourUsername>;Password=<YourPassword>;",
     // The connection string for the Hangfire job scheduler database.
     "HangfireDbConnection": "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=HangfireDb;Integrated Security=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;encrypt=true;trustServerCertificate=true",
    // Other configurations... 
    },

**Step 4: Build and Test Locally**

1.  Build the BinaryPlate.WebAPI project in Visual Studio to ensure that there are no build errors.
2.  Run the project locally to verify that the application connects to the Azure SQL Database without any issues. Perform necessary tests to ensure functionality.

**Step 5: Publish the Project to Azure**

1.  Right-click on the BinaryPlate.WebAPI project in Solution Explorer.
2.  Select "Publish" to open the publish dialog.
3.  Choose "Azure" as the target for publishing.
4.  Sign in to your Azure account if prompted.
5.  Select or create a new Azure App Service where you want to deploy the project.
6.  Configure any additional settings such as deployment slots, application insights, etc., as needed.
7.  Click "Publish" to initiate the deployment process.

**Step 6: Monitor Deployment Progress**

1.  Visual Studio will display the progress of the deployment.
2.  Once the deployment is complete, you can view the deployed application in your Azure App Service.

**Step 7: Verify Deployment**

1.  Access the deployed BinaryPlate.WebAPI application using the URL of your Azure App Service.
2.  Perform thorough testing to ensure that the application behaves as expected in the Azure environment.
3.  Monitor application logs and metrics for any errors or performance issues.

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy the BinaryPlate.WebAPI project to Azure using Visual Studio 2022 and ensure that it connects to your Azure SQL Database correctly. Adjusting the connection strings in the **appsettings.json** file ensures that your application seamlessly integrates with the Azure resources.
