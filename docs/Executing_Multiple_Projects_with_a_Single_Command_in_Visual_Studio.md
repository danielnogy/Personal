# Executing Multiple Projects with a Single Command in Visual Studio

## Introduction
This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a PowerShell script to execute multiple projects sequentially with just one command in Visual Studio. You can add as many projects as needed to the script.

### Step 1: Creating the PowerShell Script

1. Open a text editor.
2. Copy and paste the following script:

```powershell
# Define an array of project paths
$projects = @(
    "path\to\project1",
    "path\to\project2",
    # Add more project paths here as needed
)

# Iterate through each project and run it
foreach ($project in $projects) {
    # Navigate to project directory
    cd $project
    
    # Run project
    dotnet run
}
```


3. Replace `"path\to\project1"`, `"path\to\project2"`, and `"path\to\project3"`, and so on with the actual file paths to each project in your file system.
4. Save the file with a `.ps1` extension, such as `run_projects.ps1`.

### Step 2: Running the Script from Visual Studio Terminal

1. Launch Visual Studio 2022.
2. Open the integrated terminal by navigating to `View > Terminal`.
3. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your PowerShell script is located:
    ```powershell
    cd "path\to\script\directory"
    ```
4. Execute the script by typing its name preceded by `./`, for instance:
    ```powershell
    ./run_projects.ps1
    ```
5. Press Enter to execute the script.

### Conclusion
By following these instructions, you can effortlessly manage and execute multiple projects concurrently using a single command within Visual Studio. You can add as many projects as needed to the script, providing flexibility and efficiency in your development workflow.
