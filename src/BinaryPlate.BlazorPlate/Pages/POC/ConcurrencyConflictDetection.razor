            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2" Class="mb-2">Concurrency conflict occurs when multiple users attempt to edit or delete the same record simultaneously. In a multi-user environment, there is a possibility that while one user is making changes, another user may have already modified or deleted the same record. This can lead to record inconsistencies and unintended changes.</MudText>

        <MudExpansionPanel Style="font-weight:500" Class="mb-2" Text="What is the Concurrency Conflict Detection Feature in BlazorPlate?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2" Class="mb-2">The Concurrency Conflict Detection feature in BlazorPlate is a robust mechanism designed to handle situations where multiple users attempt to edit or delete the same record simultaneously. This feature ensures that data integrity is preserved and prevents data loss due to concurrent updates and deletions by multiple users.</MudText>

        <MudExpansionPanel Style="font-weight: 500" Class="mb-2" Text="How BlazorPlate Detects and Handles Concurrency Conflicts?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2" Class="mb-2">When a user makes changes to a record, BlazorPlate checks if the record has been altered by another user. If a conflict is detected during the edit operation, the system responds with a friendly error message to alert the user about the situation. The message advises the user to reload the page and try again to avoid overwriting the changes made by someone else.</MudText>
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2" Class="mb-2">Similarly, during the delete operation, BlazorPlate checks if the record has been deleted by another user. If a conflict is detected, the system responds with a friendly error message to inform the user that the record cannot be deleted as it may have been removed by someone else.</MudText>
